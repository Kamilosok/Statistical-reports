# Statistical-reports

This repository contains a collection of academic reports prepared as part of  my Statistics course in 2025/26 Winter semester at UWr

> **Note:** All reports are written in **Polish**

This repository is intended primarily as a record of academic work, because of that code used for simulations (C++) and generating graphs (Python) was intended to be seen by an audience of mathematics students so it was *simplistic* and *comprehensibility-heavy*, as such it isn't provided in the repository, the tests can easily be recreated in any programming language.

Reports are provided as `.pdf` files (for intended reading) and `.md` files (for code-like reading).
